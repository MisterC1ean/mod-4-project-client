This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Title
Ball Roller: The Reckoning is a project that connects a Ruby on Rails API and ReactJS Front End. The purpose of the project was to make a simple full stack application for the first time. The purpose of the app is to use facial recognition to control a platform and dodge falling bricks.

## Motivation
We wanted to implement several new libraries we had never worked with and create something using ReactJS. The app was intended as a simple time killer.

## Build Status
There are parts of this application that are a little rough right now. The facial library was quite out of date when we started using it and required some tuning when we first implemented it. Keep in mind this was a first try using all these technologies so there are still bugs to work out.

## Tech Stack
Ruby on Rails API, ReactJS Front End, Matter.js Physics Library, CLMTrackr Facial Recognition Library.

## Installation
Run `npm install` to load dependencies for the app and then `npm start` to load the development server.
